            <h2>Returning the Gaze</h2>
            <p>“Returning the Gaze” is an interactive 3D online exhibition which addresses the notion of the ‘gaze’ in our contemporary 
                digital culture from psychological, social and political perspectives. It displays a series of art projects along with 
                videos of panel discussions with leading voices.</p>
                
            <p> This exhibition examines how various projects employing different strategies of the ‘gaze’ can be seen to undermine various 
                forms of power structure and to promote forms of resistance. Krzystof Wodiczko’s public art installation involves eyes projected
                 onto drones that draw attention to the gaze and voices of marginalized groups. Behnaz Farahi’s project explores how literal 
                 masks might hide or reveal new identities offering strategies to the marginalized groups to develop their own secret  language. 
                 Memo Akten’s project by implementation of AI invites us to question the mechanism of visual perception  and how we learn to see 
                 the world through our gaze. Lastly, Lauren Lee McCarthy’s project addresses how the line between machine and human gaze could be 
                 blurred while the gaze of the observer influence observee’s social behaviors. </p>
                 
            <p>The idea behind this garden is to use art and technology in combination with critical thinking to convey a powerful critical 
                message which moves beyond the use of technology as an end itself but to initiate a conversation on what it means to be human.</p>

            <h2>Hall of Eyes</h2>
            <p>In her seminal article “Can The Subaltern Speak?” feminist theorist, Gayatri Spivak,
                asks whether it might be possible for the colonized – the subaltern – to have a voice
                in the face of colonial oppression. How might we reframe this same question in the
                context of contemporary digital culture? How could we find a way for the subaltern
                to speak that would also undermine the power of the oppressor?</p>
            <p>This project is inspired by the intriguing historical masks worn by
                the Bandari women from southern Iran. Legend has it that these masks were
                developed during Portuguese colonial rule, as a way of protecting the wearer
                from the gaze of slave masters looking for pretty women. Viewed from a contemporary
                perspective, they can be seen as a means of protecting women from
                patriarchal colonial oppression.</p>
            <p>In this project two masks begin to develop their own language to communicate with each
                other, blinking their eyelashes in rapid succession, using AI generated Morse code.
                The project draws upon a FaceBook experiment where – unnervingly – two AI bots began to
                develop their own language. It also draws upon an incident when an American soldier used
                his eyes to blink the word "TORTURE" using Morse Code during his captivity in Vietnam, and
                stories of women using code to report domestic abuse during the COVID19 lockdown. Here the
                ‘wink’ of the sexual predator is subverted into a language to protect women from the advances
                of a predator. This project involves AI, interactive design and critical thinking.</p>

            <h2>Hall of Drones</h2>
            <p>As the so-called refugee crisis and rising nationalistic sentiments continue to unfold in
                Europe and The United States, citizens are demanding more and more defined
                immigration laws. Though the media is often preoccupied with how the crisis will
                impact the lives of the native population, the voices of immigrants go unheard. In an
                effort to foster dialogue and mutual understanding, Loro (Them) will offer a platform
                for manifesting the stories of invisibilized members of society.
                Since the 1980s, Wodiczko has pioneered the use of new technologies to bring
                attention to situations of marginalization. In the case of Loro (Them) he uses drones
                at low altitude to generate conversations between individuals of different
                backgrounds, experience and age. To produce this complex work, More Art and
                Wodiczko partnered with Casa della Carità, a social institution which provides
                housing, counseling, medical services, occupational mentorship, cultural initiatives,
                and legal aide programs to the homeless, roma people, and immigrants.</p>

                <p>Drones are often associated with images of war, surveillance, intrusion and fear, but
                in the case of Loro (Them) the artist will quite literally anthropomorphize the
                aircrafts to reclaim a broader conversation about technology’s relationship to
                humanity. During the performance, four drones will be equipped with two screens
                showing only the eyes of the people involved in the project. A megaphone-like mouth
                will amplify each participant’s story with candor and frankness. Faces will not be
                shown to protect the individuals’ identities, but the eyes and the voice will create a
                relationship with, and at times directly address, the public.
                Each drone represents a person, elaborating on the lived experience not only of
                immigration, but more generally of social and political marginalization, addressing
                highly topical issues such as cohabitation, citizenship, representation, and even
                hospitality. The title of the project Loro (Them) immediately emphasizes the distance
                that is created by those who are mistakenly considered different—highlighting the all
                too familiar “them” vs. “us” dichotomy. At the same time, the artist seeks to cancel
                this divisive space, putting audiences face to face, albeit virtually, with real stories
                and real individuals.</p>
                 <p>Loro (Them) is a part of Milano Photo Week.</p>

            <h2>Hall of Learning To See</h2>
            <p>An artificial neural network looks out onto the world, trying to make sense of what it’s seeing, in context of what 
                it’s seen before. But it can only see through the filter of what it already knows, just like us. Because we too, see 
                things not as they are, but as we are.</p>
            
            <p>Learning to See is an ongoing series of works that use state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to reflect on ourselves 
                and how we make sense of the world. The picture we see in our conscious mind is not a mirror image of the outside world, 
                but is a reconstruction based on our expectations and prior beliefs. </p>
                
            <p>The work is part of a broader line of inquiry about self affirming cognitive biases, our inability to see the world from 
                others’ point of view, and the resulting social polarization.</p>

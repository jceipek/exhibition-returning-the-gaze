            <h1>Returning the Gaze</h1>
            <p>“Returning the Gaze” is an interactive 3D online exhibition which addresses the notion of the ‘gaze’ in
                our contemporary
                digital culture from psychological, social and political perspectives.</p>


            <p> This exhibition examines how various projects employing different strategies of the ‘gaze’ can be seen
                to undermine various
                forms of power structure and to promote forms of resistance.</p>

            <p>The idea behind this garden is to use art and technology in combination with critical thinking to convey
                a powerful critical
                message which moves beyond the use of technology as an end itself but to initiate a conversation on what
                it means to be human.</p>

            <h2>Hall of Eyes</h2>
            <p>In her seminal article “Can The Subaltern Speak?” feminist theorist, Gayatri Spivak,
                asks whether it might be possible for the colonized – the subaltern – to have a voice
                in the face of colonial oppression. How might we reframe this same question in the
                context of contemporary digital culture? How could we find a way for the subaltern
                to speak that would also undermine the power of the oppressor?</p>
            <p>This project is inspired by the intriguing historical masks worn by
                the Bandari women from southern Iran. Legend has it that these masks were
                developed during Portuguese colonial rule, as a way of protecting the wearer
                from the gaze of slave masters looking for pretty women. Viewed from a contemporary
                perspective, they can be seen as a means of protecting women from
                patriarchal colonial oppression.</p>
            <p>In this project two masks begin to develop their own language to communicate with each
                other, blinking their eyelashes in rapid succession, using AI generated Morse code.
                The project draws upon a FaceBook experiment where – unnervingly – two AI bots began to
                develop their own language. It also draws upon an incident when an American soldier used
                his eyes to blink the word "TORTURE" using Morse Code during his captivity in Vietnam, and
                stories of women using code to report domestic abuse during the COVID19 lockdown. Here the
                ‘wink’ of the sexual predator is subverted into a language to protect women from the advances
                of a predator. This project involves AI, interactive design and critical thinking.</p>

            <h2>Hall of Drones</h2>
            <p>As the so-called refugee crisis and rising nationalistic sentiments continue to unfold in
                Europe and The United States, citizens are demanding more and more defined
                immigration laws. Though the media is often preoccupied with how the crisis will
                impact the lives of the native population, the voices of immigrants go unheard. In an
                effort to foster dialogue and mutual understanding, Loro (Them) will offer a platform
                for manifesting the stories of invisibilized members of society.
                Since the 1980s, Wodiczko has pioneered the use of new technologies to bring
                attention to situations of marginalization. In the case of Loro (Them) he uses drones
                at low altitude to generate conversations between individuals of different
                backgrounds, experience and age. To produce this complex work, More Art and
                Wodiczko partnered with Casa della Carità, a social institution which provides
                housing, counseling, medical services, occupational mentorship, cultural initiatives,
                and legal aide programs to the homeless, roma people, and immigrants.</p>

            <p>Drones are often associated with images of war, surveillance, intrusion and fear, but
                in the case of Loro (Them) the artist will quite literally anthropomorphize the
                aircrafts to reclaim a broader conversation about technology’s relationship to
                humanity. During the performance, four drones will be equipped with two screens
                showing only the eyes of the people involved in the project. A megaphone-like mouth
                will amplify each participant’s story with candor and frankness. Faces will not be
                shown to protect the individuals’ identities, but the eyes and the voice will create a
                relationship with, and at times directly address, the public.
                Each drone represents a person, elaborating on the lived experience not only of
                immigration, but more generally of social and political marginalization, addressing
                highly topical issues such as cohabitation, citizenship, representation, and even
                hospitality. The title of the project Loro (Them) immediately emphasizes the distance
                that is created by those who are mistakenly considered different—highlighting the all
                too familiar “them” vs. “us” dichotomy. At the same time, the artist seeks to cancel
                this divisive space, putting audiences face to face, albeit virtually, with real stories
                and real individuals.</p>
            <p>Loro (Them) is a part of Milano Photo Week.</p>

            <h2>Hall of Learning To See</h2>
            <p>An artificial neural network looks out onto the world, and tries to make sense of what it is seeing. But
                it can only see through the filter of what it already knows.</p>

            <p>Just like us.</p>

            <p>Because we too, see things not as they are, but as we are.</p>

            <hr />

            <p>In this context, the term <em>seeing</em>, refers to both the low level perceptual and phenomenological
                experience of vision, as well as the higher level cognitive act of <em>making meaning</em>, and
                constructing what we consider to be <em>truth</em>. Our self affirming cognitive biases and prejudices,
                define what we see, and how we interact with each other as a result, fuelling our inability to see the
                world from each others’ point of view, driving social and political polarization. The interesting
                question isn't only "when you and I look at the same image, do we see the same colors and shapes", but
                also "when you and I read the same article, do we see the same story and perspectives?".

            <p>Everything that we see, read, or hear, we try to make sense of by relating to our own past experiences,
                filtered by our prior beliefs and knowledge.</p>

            <p>In fact, even these sentences that I'm typing right now, I have no idea, what any of it means to you.
                It’s impossible for me to see the world through your eyes, think what you think, and feel what you feel,
                without having read everything that you’ve ever read, seen everything that you’ve ever seen, and lived
                everything that you’ve ever lived.</p>

            <p>Empathy and compassion are much harder than we might realize, and that makes them all the more valuable
                and essential. </p>

            <hr />

            <p><em>Learning to See</em> is an ongoing series of works that use state-of-the-art machine learning
                algorithms to reflect on ourselves and how we make sense of the world. The picture we see in our
                conscious mind is not a mirror image of the outside world, but is a reconstruction based on our
                expectations and prior beliefs.</p>

                    As utopian fantasies of “global” interconnectedness fade in relation to a global pandemic and
                    burgeoning nationalisms,
                    it is important to develop strategies to foster a sense of inclusion and overcome a culture of
                    exclusion.
                    This panel discussion addresses what role might art and design might play to maintain a sense of
                    transculturalism and
                    how they might allow us to see things differently.
